LEM-IN

The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.

• Quickest way means the solution with the least number of instructions.

• The ants have to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.

• At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is
to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can
only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain
as many ants as necessary.)
